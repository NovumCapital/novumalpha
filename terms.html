			<p>No warranty or representation is made in respect to the information on this website, which is subject to change without notice, including without limitation, that the information is accurate, complete or timely. &nbsp;We believe that the opinions expressed and information on this website are accurate at the date of publication. The information on this website has not been registered, verified or approved by any local regulator.</p>
			<p><strong>5. No Investment Advice</strong></p>
			<p>Nothing on this website should be construed as investment advice by Novum or any other regulated activity. &nbsp;Participation and/or purchase of any of Novum’s product(s) and/or service(s) may not be suitable for all clients and should only be made on the basis of the prospectus and other documentation governing that fund, which may be obtained free of charge on this website. &nbsp;This website is not a substitute for independent professional advice and users of this website should obtain appropriate professional advice relevant to their particular circumstances prior to making any relevant decisions. The website must not be relied upon in connection with any decision to participate in and/or purchase any of Novum’s product(s) and/or service(s).</p>
			<p><strong>6. General Risk Warnings</strong></p>
			<p>The fund prices and performance on this website are indicative only and should not be relied upon for dealing purposes. You should be aware that this information has not been audited or verified by an independent party.</p>
			<p>This site may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are typically identified by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “will”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “plans”, “intends”, “believes”, “estimates”, “projects”, “predicts”, “seeks”, “potential”, “continue” or other similar terminology or by discussion of strategy, plans, objectives, goals, future events or intentions. Any such forward-looking statement is based on Novum’s expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about future events at the date of publication. Actual outcomes are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in a forward-looking statement. Given these inherent risks and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Novum has no obligation to update or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or for any other reason.</p>
			<p>The value of digital assets and any income from them may go down as well as up and clients may get back less than the amount of cryptocurrency originally allocated with Novum. Past performance is not a guide to future performance. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the value of an investment and any income derived from it. Certain allocations involving cryptocurrencies, digital assets and/or their derivative products, involve an above-average degree of risk and should be seen as long-term in nature.</p>
			<p>The list of risk factors is not exhaustive and you should refer also to the relevant product(s) and/or service(s) prospectus or any other relevant documents for additional risk factors pertaining to that product and/or service. Please note that Novum will not regard any user of this website as its client for regulatory purposes merely because such user has visited or used this website and will not owe any duties to any such user in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws and regulations.</p>
